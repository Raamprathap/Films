This repository hosts a web application that dynamically displays all the video files stored in a specified folder on a user-friendly website. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and a lightweight backend (Flask/Node.js) to fetch and render video content. Key features include:

Automatic detection of all video files (e.g., .mp4, .avi, .mov) in the folder.
Video playback with controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen).
A responsive grid layout to organize and display videos efficiently.
Option to add video titles or descriptions fetched from filenames or metadata.
Easy-to-deploy setup for local or remote hosting.
Perfect for creating a simple video gallery to showcase or browse media collections!
